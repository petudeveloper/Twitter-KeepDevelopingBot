The bot checks for and replies/fav every 30 seconds.


## Built With

- Ruby
  - chatterbot (GEM)
  - dotenv (GEM)
- Twitter API


## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and run the program do these steps on the console:
- To clone the project to your machine, run `git clone https://github.com/petumazo/KeepDevelopingBot.git`.
- To install the required dependencies, run `bundle install`. 
- For it to run you'll have to get your _Token, Secret Toke, Consumer Key_ and _Consumer_Secret_, if you don¬¥t know-how, you can check the [official twitter guide](https://developer.twitter.com/ja/docs/basics/authentication/guides/access-tokens) on how to get your access tokens. 
- If you're still confused and you don¬¥t know how to generate your access tokens follow these steps:
  - Login to your Twitter account on [Twitter Developer](developer.twitter.com) and ask for access to Twitter API, follow this [video tutorial] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlvtqp44xoQ) if you feel confused.
  - Navigate to the [Twitter app dashboard](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps) and open the Twitter app for which you would like to generate access tokens.
  - Navigate to the "Keys and Tokens" page.
  - Select 'Create' under the "Access token & access token secret" section.
- To run the bot, run `bin/Keep_developing_bot.rb` in the console.
- Remember (_To generate your access token and secret, you must have a Twitter app. You will need to register an application with Twitter. Twitter requires all API communication to be via an app which is registered on Twitter._)

- To run RSpec:
  - run 'gem install rspec' on your console from the root directory
  - run 'rspec' to check for tests
